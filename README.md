# nmap-python
Python Script for my most used nmap scripts

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31233780/nameerror-when-using-input-with-python-3-4
written in Python 3.4.4
version is printed out on the output
If you receive "File "<string>", line 1" when running look at the version information printed.
If it shows other than 3.4 use "python nmap3.py" on Win or python3 on Linux
once you select a number you will be asked for an IP address or SNMP string if the script requires it
The script will output the appropriate nmap command. Copy it and paste into a command line or shell

ToDo
Add error checking for invalid IP addresses
Add switch for Linux vs Windows output
